Debt Planner
============

A Scheme script implemented in Guile in order to:
- Calculate the debt repayment of an annuity loan.
- Define follow-up loans as series
- Pretty-print detail plan to screen
- Use it as interface for optimization algorithms

This is experimental work in progress. Internationalization via *gettext* on
the way.
